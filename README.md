# MusicScheduler
The MusicScheduler lets people in the same room manage one music queue. Every user can enter his songs into the queue and the MusicScheduler will automatically schedule the music based on user playtime.

## Ideas
- Support for YouTube-Playlists
- Display current queue
- Display history (last played songs) with possibility to add already played songs back to the queue
- Save Queue/Playlist
- Streaming instead of downloading the music
